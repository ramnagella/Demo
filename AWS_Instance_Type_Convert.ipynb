        "              Amazon Redshift is a fully managed cloud-based data warehouse service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to help users analyze and query large amounts of data using standard SQL and existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools.\n",
        "    2. Redshift access Requirements:\n",
        "    To create the connection asset, you need these connection details:\n",
        "â€¢\tDatabase name\n",
        "â€¢\tHostname or IP address\n",
        "â€¢\tPort number\n",

        "it is a fully managed,relational database management service based on the PostgreSQL engine. It can handle petabyte-scale data while offering lightning-fast querying performance. The query handling efficiency is achieved through the combination of:\n",
        "\n",
        "Â· highly parallel processing (shared-nothing system): the service uses a number of processors to perform coordinated computations in parallel,\n",
        "Â· a columnar database design: it delivers column-orientated technology on an as-a-service basis, making it affordable, easy, and fast to get up and running with,\n",
        "Â· data compression of columns: owing to columnar data storage, Redshift automatically can use adaptive compression encoding, depending on the column data type,\n",
        "Â· a query optimizer: it uses analyzed information about tables to generate efficient query plans for execution,\n",
        "Â· compiled query code: the query execution engine compiles the query into machine code and distributes it to the cluster nodes. The compiled code executes faster because it eliminates the overhead of using an interpreter\n",
